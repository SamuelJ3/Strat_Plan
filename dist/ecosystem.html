				<br /><br />
				Info Tech Systems business primary market is infrastructure construction. Our customers are 
				the government “owner” agencies and private companies involved in building and maintaining 
				infrastructure such as roadways, bridges, airports, and so on. This is the ecosystem within 
				which our customers do business. Following is a “twenty thousand foot” orientation on the 
				ecosystem.
				<br /><br />
				In most cases the “owner” we service is a government agency such as the Florida Department 
				of Transportation. So while the owners may not own the infrastructure in the strict legal 
				sense, we use that blanket term to refer to them. Due to budget and staffing constraints 
				many owners employ consultants to support the owner’s infrastructure construction and 
				maintenance activities in a variety of roles.
				<br /><br />
				Then there are those who perform the construction: the contractors who do the work and 
				suppliers who supply the required materials and components. The “prime” contractor is 
				the contractor to whom the owner awarded the construction project contract. The prime 
				contractor is contractually accountable for the entire project outcome, including what 
				the suppliers provide and the work performed by other contractors to whom the prime 
				contractor subcontracted part of the work.
				<br /><br />
				AASHTOWare Project is focused on meeting the needs of AASHTO’s members: state-level 
				infrastructure owner agencies such as the Florida Department of Transportation. Info Tech’s 
				“ITI Products” services facilitate the interactions between the state-level owner agencies 
				and the companies who do the work. ITI Products services also address the needs of “local” 
				infrastructure owners such as counties and cities.
				<br /><br />
				The following diagram illustrates the primary relationships between the owners and the other 
				construction project participants and the degree to which each uses ITI Products and 
				AASHTOWare Project. (Click the diagram for a larger view.)

				<br /><br />
				In cases where a local owner agency is managing a construction project (a.k.a. “job”) that is 
				in any way funded with federal or state level funding, the state-level owner agency is 
				responsible for insuring that the project is properly run. In those cases the state-level 
				agency may require the local agency to use AASHTOWare Project to manage the project.
				<br /><br />
				<b style="font-size: 2.6rem">The Product Ecosystem</b>
				<br /><br />
				Construction projects go through a series of lifecycle stages: planning/design, preconstruction, 
				bidding, and construction. Once construction is complete the assets that were built move into a 
				management/maintenance stage. Click the diagram to drill down into more about these phases, the 
				role of ITI Products and AASHTOWare Project in the phases, and which project participants use 
				the products and services when. (Click the diagram for a larger view.)
