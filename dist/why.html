                Through targeted approaches, we will grow our market, remain people-focused and make the world a 
                better place.
				<br /><br />
                <b>We created our market and plan to keep growing it.</b> We are a homegrown company, and we won’t 
                forget where we came from as we embark on a growth strategy. We will continue to steadfastly 
                support DOTs, AASHTO and their products. Plus, we will increase our drive to provide contractors 
                and consultants with the best tools they need for their businesses and their work with owners and 
                agencies. When we achieve this, we will not only grow, but will be in a position to support the 
                entire infrastructure construction ecosystem between owners, contractors and consultants, offering 
                solutions that ensure value promised is value delivered. 
                <br /><br />
                <b>As we grow, our people will remain at the core of our success.</b> We didn’t get to today based on our 
                ideas alone but through the power of collaboration. And, we won’t get to the future without our 
                committed, talented family of employees. We value people first. We believe in investing in people. 
                We view our customers as an extension of our family. We pride ourselves on building long-lasting, 
                authentic relationships and treating people with respect. And, we live for the people who help us 
                achieve the goals of our customers and those of our own.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Our goal is to make the world a better place.</b> We create tools and technology that make things easier 
                for those who build, own, operate and maintain our country’s infrastructure. Our initial software was 
                created to ensure fair and free competition in a competitive market, and still to this day, our 
                solutions protect and highlight truth because we believe that will have the greatest impact on our 
                world. 
                <br /><br />
                <b>Ultimately, we will deliver a drive only Info Tech can build.</b> The world is driven by technology, and 
                the technology that builds our world is driven by Info Tech.
